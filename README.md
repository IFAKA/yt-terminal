## ⚙️ How It Works (For the Curious)

1. **Search** - `yt-dlp` fetches results from YouTube
2. **Display** - `fzf` shows beautiful interactive menu with thumbnails
3. **Play** - `mpv` streams in high quality (up to 1080p)
4. **Cache** - Smart caching makes repeat searches instant

## 🛠️ Configuration (Optional)

**File location:** `~/.config/yt/config`

**Useful tweaks:**
```bash
NUM_RESULTS=20                # More results (default: 10)
MAX_QUALITY=1080              # Video quality (default: 1080p)
CACHE_EXPIRY=7200            # Longer cache (default: 1hr)
VOLUME=80                     # Lower volume (default: 100)
HIGH_CONTRAST_MODE=true       # Better visibility
```

**Default settings work great for most people** - only change if you want to!
